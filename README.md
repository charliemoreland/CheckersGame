## Game Play
You start with 12 pieces on each side and they are red or black. You play by moving your piece only in one direction which is usually up. You take the opposite players pieces by jumping over them. Once you reach the opposite end you become a king and you can move your piece in any direction. To win the game you must collect all the other players peieces. You start by entering your name under player 1 and player 2.

### Checkerboard
There is a checkerboard with 64 squares that are black and red. In alternating squares there will be a checker piece either red or black according to the side. There will then be two rows in the middle that no pieces are in for the start of the game
